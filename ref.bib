  abstract = 	 {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown extraordinary performance in a number of applications, but they are usually of heavy design for the accuracy reason. Beyond compressing the filters in CNNs, this paper focuses on the redundancy in the feature maps derived from the large number of filters in a layer. We propose to extract intrinsic representation of the feature maps and preserve the discriminability of the features. Circulant matrix is employed to formulate the feature map transformation, which only requires O(dlog d) computation complexity to embed a d-dimensional feature map. The filter is then re-configured to establish the mapping from original input to the new compact feature map, and the resulting network can preserve intrinsic information of the original network with significantly fewer parameters, which not only decreases the online memory for launching CNN but also accelerates the computation speed. Experiments on benchmark image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art methods.}

  abstract = 	 {We propose a novel deep neural network that is both lightweight and effectively structured for model parallelization. Our network, which we name as SplitNet, automatically learns to split the network weights into either a set or a hierarchy of multiple groups that use disjoint sets of features, by learning both the class-to-group and feature-to-group assignment matrices along with the network weights. This produces a tree-structured network that involves no connection between branched subtrees of semantically disparate class groups. SplitNet thus greatly reduces the number of parameters and requires significantly less computations, and is also embarrassingly model parallelizable at test time, since the network evaluation for each subnetwork is completely independent except for the shared lower layer weights that can be duplicated over multiple processors. We validate our method with two deep network models (ResNet and AlexNet) on two different datasets (CIFAR-100 and ILSVRC 2012) for image classification, on which our method obtains networks with significantly reduced number of parameters while achieving comparable or superior classification accuracies over original full deep networks, and accelerated test speed with multiple GPUs.}
